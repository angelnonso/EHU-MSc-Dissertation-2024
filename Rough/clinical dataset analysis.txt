 - Identifying incident dementia by applying machine learning to a very large administrative claims dataset

Summary of the Paper
Objective: The study aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) using administrative claims data.
Dataset: The model was trained on a national de-identified dataset from OptumLabs, containing data from over 125 million patients.
Features Selected: The top features included diagnosis codes like memory loss, Parkinson’s disease, mild cognitive impairment, and bipolar disorder, as well as pharmacy codes for psychoactive drugs3.
Feature Selection Method: The Lasso algorithm was used for feature selection, identifying the top 50 predictors for the final model.

The study achieved relatively low accuracy (AUC of 0.693) despite using a large dataset of 125 million patients due to several factors:

Data Sparsity: Many individuals had very few medical codes in their claims, making it difficult to gather enough information for accurate predictions.
Imbalanced Dataset: The dataset had a small proportion of dementia cases compared to controls, which can lead to misclassification.
Complexity of Dementia: Dementia has multifactorial causes and varied presentations, making it challenging to predict with high accuracy using claims data alone.
Coding Variability: Differences in how dementia is coded and diagnosed across different providers and regions can affect model performance.

 - Automated Functional and Behavioral HealthAssessment of Older Adults with Dementia

The paper used data collected from 17 older adults living in a continuing care retirement community in Baltimore. The participants included:

6 with dementia
3 with mild cognitive impairment
8 without cognitive impairment
The data was gathered over a 5-month study period and involved monitoring their daily activities and physiological signals using wearable sensors and smart home technologies.
The dataset used in the paper consists of data from 17 older adults. While it might seem small, such datasets can still provide valuable insights, especially in specialized studies like this one. Smaller datasets are often used in preliminary research to identify trends and patterns before larger-scale studies are conducted.

Objective: The study aims to improve the automatic assessment of dementia by using physiological and ambient sensors to track daily activities and mental arousal states of older adults1.
Methodology: The researchers employed signal processing on wearable sensor data (e.g., EDA, PPG, ACC) and machine learning algorithms to assess cognitive impairments and their correlation with functional health decline2.
Validation: The approach was validated by comparing machine learning and survey-based scores with clinically observed scores among 17 older adults in a retirement community3.
Findings: The study found that technology-guided automated scores can effectively estimate cognitive health and functional decline in older adults with dementia4.

2. - Dementia Prediction Using OASIS Data for Alzheimer’s Research by Mr. Rahul B. Diwate, Mr. Ridhya Ghosh, Mr. Rituraj Jha, Mr. Ishu Sagar, and Mr. Saket Kumar Singh 

The paper explores the use of machine learning models to predict dementia using data from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). Here are the key points:

Objective: The study aims to predict dementia by analyzing longitudinal brain data from the OASIS dataset.
Methods: Various machine learning models, including Multilayer Perceptron and Decision Tree, were employed. These models were evaluated based on their accuracy and recall.
Findings: The Multilayer Perceptron and Decision Tree models achieved an accuracy of 83.9% and recall rates of 83.6% and 80.0%, respectively1.
Conclusion: The study demonstrates that machine learning models can effectively predict dementia using social and biological data, without the need for brain MRI images.
This research highlights the potential of machine learning in early dementia diagnosis, which can significantly impact patient care and treatment outcomes.
Dataset: OASIS longitudinal dataset.

META DATA 
The dataset comprises of 15 columns - Subject ID, MRI ID, Group, Visit, MR Delay, M/F, Hand, Age, EDUC (education years), SES (socio economic status), MMSE (mini mental state examination), CDR (clinical dementia ratio), eTIV (estimated Total Intracranial Volume), nWBV (normalized whole brain volume), ASF (Atlas Scaling Factor). 
A total of 150 subjects’ data were collected resulting in 373 unique values.

DATA CLEANING 
The dataset had a total of 21 null values: 19 in SES [socioeconomic status] and 2 in MMSE [mini mental state examination]. Since both aren't sensitive medical data, the null values were replaced by the median of the respective data. Some features were removed from the data since they played no role in predicting the target variable. These were: 
a) Subject ID 
b) MRI ID 
c) Visit 
d) MR Delay

FEATURE SELECTION 
The dataset consists of 15 features out of which 4 were removed during data cleaning. These features include Subject ID, MRI ID , Visit and MR Delay. All these features provide no information which may be useful for prediction of dementia as these are used for patient identification and equipment error and hence were removed. A correlation map was used to determine the correlation between the other features.

TRAIN - TEST SPLIT 
The data was split into 261 training samples and 112 test samples.

LIMITATIONS
The study “Dementia Prediction Using OASIS Data for Alzheimer’s Research” highlights several limitations and areas for improvement:
Complexity of Machine Learning Models: While machine learning models like Multilayer Perceptron and Decision Tree showed promising results, they often struggle with the complexity of analyzing numeric biological and social data1.
Need for Enhanced Methodological Rigour: Many predictive modeling studies lack rigorous methodologies, leading to a high risk of bias2. Future research should focus on improving the methodological rigor and conducting external validation of the models.
Data Limitations: The reliance on specific datasets like OASIS may limit the generalizability of the findings. Expanding the dataset to include more diverse populations could improve the robustness of the models1.
Integration of Multimodal Data: Future research could benefit from integrating various types of data, such as genetic, clinical, and lifestyle information, to enhance the accuracy of dementia predictions1.
Longitudinal Studies: Conducting more longitudinal studies could provide deeper insights into the progression of Alzheimer’s disease and improve early prediction models1.
These areas for improvement and future research directions aim to enhance the accuracy and applicability of dementia prediction models, ultimately aiding in early diagnosis and better patient outcomes.

3. - A Novel Approach Utilizing Machine Learning for the Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease by Khandaker Mohammad Mohi Uddin, Mir Jafikul Alam, Jannat-E-Anawar, Md Ashraf Uddin & Sunil Aryal 

Objective: The paper proposes a machine learning model to predict Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using various algorithms like GaussianNB, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Voting Classifier, and GradientBoost1.
Dataset: The model is trained on the OASIS dataset, which includes MRI data from 150 individuals aged 60 to 96.
Results: The Voting Classifier achieved the highest validation accuracy of 96%23.
Significance: Early diagnosis of AD can help in better management and treatment, potentially reducing the disease’s impact on patients and their families.

DATA CLEANING:
The paper employs several data cleaning methods to prepare the dataset for machine learning models:
Handling Missing Values: Missing values in the dataset are imputed using the mean method for most features and the mode method for the “MMSE” feature.
Data Redundancy: Redundant data is removed to improve the accuracy of the machine learning algorithms1.
Feature Selection and Scaling: Relevant features are selected, and feature scaling is performed to enhance model performance.
These steps ensure the dataset is clean and suitable for training the machine learning models

FEATURE SELECTION 
The key features of the dataset and the feature selection method used in the paper:
Dataset Features: The dataset includes attributes such as age, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, normalized whole brain volume (nWBV), and cortical thickness.
Feature Selection: The SelectKBest method was used for feature selection, which identifies the best features based on the highest scores1. The f_class scoring function was applied to select the most relevant features for the model.

TRAIN - TEST SPLIT
The paper mentions that the data was split into 80% for training and 20% for testing. This split was used to train the machine learning model for predicting Alzheimer’s disease.

LIMITATIONS
The limitations and areas for improvement discussed in the study:
Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing can compromise data integrity, affecting model performance1. Approaches like data augmentation and cross-validation are suggested to address this.
Feature Selection: Identifying relevant features is crucial. Future research should focus on removing redundant features and extracting unique ones to improve detection accuracy2.
Model Validation: Overfitting is a concern. The study uses 10-fold cross-validation to mitigate this, but further refinement is needed.
Early Detection: More research is required to establish reliable traits for early Alzheimer’s detection, which remains challenging.
